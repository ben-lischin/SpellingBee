# Spelling Bee
My adaptation of the New York Times' Spelling Bee Game


The game presents 7 letters, from which you can create words\
The central letter is special, so we have colored it purple

An entered word must...\
• use only the available letters (can repeat the letters)\
• contain 4+ letters\
• contain the center (purple) letter\
• be a word in the dictionary (for our purposes, contained in words.txt)\
• not be a duplicate of an already-entered word

Scoring works as follows:\
• 1 point awarded for a 4-letter word\
• +1 point for every additional letter beyond the first four\
• +7 bonus points for entering a panagram (uses all 7 letters)
